        Hyperlocal Mapping of Air Pollution and GHG emissions

        Hyperlocal Mapping of Air Pollution project is part of the Climate &amp;
        Energy Lacuna Fund cohort of 2023.

      <span className="font-normal text-[20px] leading-[28.16px] p-[20px] text-justify">
        Under this initiative, a novel approach is employed by leveraging
        citizen scientists and IoT-based low-cost sensors to collect hyperlocal
        air quality data. This data is used to identify pollution sources and
        risk zones, facilitating targeted actions by regulatory authorities.

      <span className="font-normal text-[20px] leading-[28.16px] p-[20px] text-justify">
        To showcase data outreach, the project features the VAYU Android-based
        application and the VAYU citizen portal digital stack, which support
        targeted interventions and customized solutions backed by AI/ML
        algorithms. These tools potentially develop new approaches in air
        pollution management while reducing public investment costs.
